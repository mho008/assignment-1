<br>

<h2 style="font-family:Didot; font-size:150%;">A Brief History</h2>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;"> The first botanical garden was set up by Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore and a keen naturalist, in 1822 on Government Hill at Fort Canning, mainly to introduce into cultivation economic crops. It closed in 1829 and, in 1859, at the present Tanglin site a new garden was developed by an Agri-Horticultural Society, and later handed over to the government in 1874. From an ornamental garden with roads, terraces, a band parade area and even a small zoo, it has come a long way in evolving into a leading equatorial botanic garden of 82 hectares, where major world crops, such as rubber and orchids were launched.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;"> In June 2012, Singapore ratified the World Heritage Convention and in December 2012, submitted its World Heritage Tentative List to UNESCO to indicate interest in inscribing the Singapore Botanic Gardens as a World Heritage Site.
</p> 

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">In January 2014, the official Nomination Dossier for the Gardens was submitted to UNESCO. In September 2014, a technical assessor from the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) visited the Gardens as part of the bid evaluation process.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">On 4 July 2015, the Gardens received inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage Site at the 39th session of the World Heritage Committee. (WHC) </p>

<h2 style="font-family:Didot; font-size:150%;">About The Garden</h2>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">The Gardens was originally developed along a 3-Core Concept. The three cores comprised of:</p>
<ol style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px; text-align:left"> 
<li> <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/tanglin-entrance">Tanglin</a> - which is the heritage core retaining the old favourites and charms of the historic Gardens</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/nassim-entrance">Central</a> - the tourist belt of the Gardens</li>
<li> <a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/bukit-timah-core">Bukit Timah</a> - the educational and discovery zone</li>
</ol>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">A fourth core,<a href="https://www.nparks.gov.sg/sbg/our-gardens/bukit-timah-core">Tyersall-Gallop</a>, was created with the opening in 2017 of the Learning Forest which is designed to integrate into the Gardens' existing rainforest to form an enlarged forest habitat.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">Each Core presents an exciting array of attractions. Take your time to stroll around the Gardens and enjoy the wonderful sights, sounds and wonders the luscious greenery offers.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Didot; font-size:130%;">The Halia</h3>
<img src="the halia1.jpg" alt="The Halia" width="450" height="250">
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">Halia – Malay for ginger – is located in the one-hectare Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens where over 250 species of gingers with their stunning foliage and colourful flowers thrive. The construction of Halia was carried out simultaneously with the development of the Ginger Garden in the year 2000. Careful consideration was given to the special park setting, such that architecture conformed to the contours of the land, the dignity of mature trees and the preservation of heritage.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">
In 2001, the Halia was officially opened. The result is an unobtrusive dining room with full height glass windows, beckoning the greenery indoors, and allowing guests to dine in the Garden whilst still comfortably ensconced in cool surroundings. Decades-old majestic palm trees stand like sentries, guardian-witness to the earthy beauty that is the Singapore Botanic Gardens.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">Casa Verde is a casual trattoria nestled within the lush greenery of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Their name, which means ‘Green House’ in Italian, is particularly apt for their restaurant, given their relaxing atmosphere amidst verdant garden landscapes.</p>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">Apart from wholesome and affordable pastas, Italian sandwiches and wood-fired thin crust pizzas, Casa Verde also offers a number of local favourites, appealing to Singaporeans and tourists alike.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:Didot; font-size:130%;">National Orchid Garden</h2>
<img src="national orchid garden.jpg" width="450" height="300">
<br>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;"> With the Orchid being Singapore's national flower, it is no surprise that we have a garden dedicated to showcasing the flowers on their own. Opened on 20th October 1995 by Former Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, the National Orchid Garden is located on the highest hill in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Three hectares of carefully landscaped slopes provide a setting for over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids, with about 600 species and hybrids on display. </p>

<img src="national orchid garden 3.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<br>

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;"> The distinctive feature of the National Orchid Garden not to be missed is its design concept which presents the display of plants in four separate colour zones over most of its areas:</p>

<ul style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px; text-align:left;">
<li>"spring" zone with its prevailing colours of bright and lively shades of gold, yellow and creams</li>
<li>"summer" zone with its major tones of strong reds and pinks </li>
<li>"autumn" zone of matured shades </li>
<li>"winter" zone of whites and cool violet shades</li>
</ul>

<img src="national orchid garden4.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<br> 

<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;"> This colour zoning is achieved by a careful blend of selected trees, shrubs, herbs and orchids (mostly hybrids) with matching foliage and floral colours.</p>

<img src="national orchid garden2.jpg" alt="Prince William and Kate Middleton with their orchid hybrid, Vanda William Catherine" width="500" height="300">
<br>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">Fun fact:The National Orchid Garden section of the Botanic gardens houses orchids named after the likes of Elton John, Jackie Chan and even Princess Diana and Nelson Mandela. More recently, Kate Middleton and Prince William were presented the Vanda William Catherine - a white and purple free-flowering orchid hybrid. </p>

<img src="jacob ballas1.jpg" alt="Treehouse playground in Jacob Ballas Children's Garden" width ="450" height="300">
<br>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;"> The Jacob Ballas Children’s Garden is the first garden in Asia dedicated to children. Its theme of ‘Life on Earth Depends on Plants’ aims to educate and instil a love for nature in children. The Garden is a complete nature-learning environment, where children can delve deeper into the ecology of plants and our environment through discovery and experiential learning. It offers children a space for exploration, adventure and play, with a farm, an orchard, and a forest with its own stream and ponds. </p> 

<h3 style="font-family:Didot; font-size:130%;">Palm Valley and Symphony Lake</h3>

<br>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">
Here the land falls away from the wooded skyline of tall forest trees into a grand valley swept with palms ranging in size from the squat Mexican Fan Palm, Washingtonia robusta, to members of the ‘skyscraper’ fan palm genus, Livistona. At one end of the valley, families and music enthusiasts regularly gather for orchestral performances at the Shaw Foundation Symphony Stage.</p>


<h3 style="font-family:Didot; font-size:130%;">The Bandstand</h3>
<img src="bandstand.jpg" alt="The Bandstand" width="450" height="300">
<br>
<p style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:14px;">The octagonal gazebo known as the Bandstand was erected in 1930 and has retained its original form over the years. The Bandstand site was initially just a small hill that stood at 33 m above sea level and was the highest point at the Tanglin Core site. This hill was levelled off around 1860s to serve as the site for regimental bands to perform surrounded by terraced flower beds and palms.Although no longer used for music performances, it is a favourite wedding photo spot and an iconic landmark of the Gardens.

This tranquil sundial garden was originally laid out in 1929 by the Director of the Botanic Gardens Eric Holttum whose wife designed the sundial with its enigmatic inscription. Four water lily tanks were added in the 1970s and four Grecian statues in 2006.</p>
